# Read-based AAV vector type classification

## Definitions

Table: Reference label definitions.

Reference Label    |Definition
:-----------------:|----------------------------------------------------
vector             |Read originates from the vector plasmid.
repcap             |Read originates from the RepCap plasmid. The Rep gene encodes four proteins (Rep78, Rep68, Rep52, and Rep40), which are required for viral genome replication and packaging, while Cap expression gives rise to the viral capsid proteins (VP; VP1/VP2/VP3), which form the outer capsid shell that protects the viral genome, as well as being actively involved in cell binding and internalization.
helper             |Read originates from the helper plasmid. In addition to Rep and Cap, AAV requires a helper plasmid containing genes from adenovirus. These genes (E4, E2a and VA) mediate AAV replication.
host               |Read originates from the host genome that is given (e.g. hg38, CHM13).
chimeric-vector    |One part of the read aligns to the vector plasmid, while another part of the same read aligns to a different reference sequence.
chimeric-nonvector |The read consists of fragments that align to two or more different reference sequences, neither of which is the vector plasmid.


Table: Assigned type definitions.

Assigned Type|Definition
:-----------:|----------------------------------------------------
ssAAV        |Single-stranded AAV vector genome where the resulting DNA template is expected to be single-stranded, as opposed to self-complementary. A sequencing read is inferred as ssAAV if it has a single alignment to the vector plasmid’s ITR-to-ITR payload region and no complementary supplemental alignment.
scAAV        |Self-complementary AAV vector genome where one half of the payload region is a reverse complement of the other, resulting in an intramolecular double-stranded DNA template. A sequencing read is inferred as scAAV if it aligns to the payload region in both forward (+) and reverse (-) read directions.
backbone     |Read aligns to the vector plasmid sequence but fully outside of the annotated ITR-to-ITR region, indicating that the sequence fragment originated solely from the plasmid backbone.
other-vector |Read consists of a fragment mapping to the vector but with characteristics other than those listed above.


`<br />`{=html}

![Single-stranded AAV types (ssAAV).
ssAAV reads must fully map within the vector genome (which can contain the backbone, beyond the ITR region) consisting of a single (primary) alignment.
"ssAAV-full" reads must cover from left ITR to right ITR.
"ssAAV-left-partial" contain the left ITR but are missing the right ITR.
"scAAV-vector+backbone" map partially within the ITR and partially to the backbone.

![Self-complementary AAV types (scAAV).
scAAV reads must fully map within the vector genome (which can contain the backbone, beyond the ITR region) consisting of both primary and supplementary alignments.
The definitions of full, partial, and backbone reads are the same as in ssAAV.

# Methods

This report was generated by an automated analysis of long-read sequencing data from
adeno-associated virus (AAV) products.
The sequencing data should be from the PacBio sequencer run in AAV mode, or equivalent
circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads (Travers et al., 2010).

In this analysis, reads are aligned to the given AAV, packaging, and host reference
sequences using Minimap2 (Li, 2018).
The reference sequences for each primary alignment and its orientation are counted and
summarized to assign read type classifications, including vector, non-vector, and
chimeric reads.
For reads assigned to the AAV vector, the primary alignment coordinates are compared to
the annotated vector region in the reference sequence, which comprises the left and
right ITRs and the genomic region between them, to assign each read to a subtype
classification.
Sequence variants relative to the vector reference sequence are determined directly from
each read's alignment, specifically the CIGAR string indicating insertions, deletions,
mismatches, and gaps.
